___________
Errors


- `All Errors` will return with an error status and an object with an error key. The error message is written there. 

______

## Sockets

`Authorization` When connecting the socket must provide a valid bearer JSON web token to be authorized for socket useage. This socket connection can only be from the designated client's url. The Authorization header must be set in the extraHeaders for the client. 

Example client socket: 

    const socket = io(URL, {
        transportOptions: {
            polling: {
                extraHeaders: {
                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${some-jwt-here}`
                }
            }
        }
    });

___

`On 'join_room'` Socket must provide either the string 'random' or a valid UUID pertaining to the room_id of a game they are a part of. If 'random' is provided they are connected to a game in the queue if there is one otherwise they are connected to a random room and put in the queue. 

This allows for the pairing of client's in a match. One cannot play against themselves nor have more than 10 active games. 

If 'random' is provided the socket will be notified through the `joined` channel. Otherwise if a room id is provided the socket will be notified through the `reconnected` channel. 

___

`On 'fire'` Socket must provide an object with keys for the target they wish to fire upon, the game id and room id. 

This will check to see if the socket's shot was a hit/miss and notify both users through the `response` channel. If the socket's shot wins the game both users will be notified through the `win` channel. 

Example object from client: 

    {
        target: 'A1',
        gameId: 1,
        roomId: [UUID]
    }

___

`On 'ships_ready'` Used to notify the other user that your ships have been set. The other user in the room will be notified through the `opponent_ready` channel. 
___

`On 'send-message'` Used to send a message to the other user in the room. This allows for chat functionality. Socket must provide an object with keys for the room and message they wish to send. 

The other user will be notified through the `chat-message` channel.

Example object from client: 

    {
        room: [UUID],
        message: 'This is the message.'
    }

___

## Summary

This server allows for the connection of two users to facilitate playing the classic boardgame Battleship. 

They are matched against other Users through the use of websockets and express routing. The gameplay is actively updated so players can play in real time. 

The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database which allows users to player passively agaisnt their opponent as well. 

## Technology Used

Javascript, PostgreSQL, Express, Mocha, Chai, Socket .io
